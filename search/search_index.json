BIMS deploys with an instance of GeoNode that can be used for publishing these layers, but you can use any standards compliant web mapping server for this purpose. First let us define the terms 'GeoContext Layer' and 'Visualisation Layer': GeoContext layers are layers that you publish online as an OGC web service with the explicit intention that these layers are harvested by the https://geocontext.kartoza.com GeoContext service. Visualisation layers are used in the layer selector in BIMS and allow the user to add map overlays in the BIMS map view - for example to show soil types or catchment boundaries on the map. In the next steps we will show you how to publish both of these types of layers. Publishing a layer in GeoNode \u00b6 This article gives a short explanation of how to publish a layer in GeoNode.

To add metadata to the layer in GeoNode please follow this guide : https://docs.geonode.org/en/master/usage/managing_layers/layer_metadata.html . Discovering the WMS URL for a published layer \u00b6 In this guide we show you how to find out the WMS URL for a published layer so that the layer can be published in GeoContext or as a GeoContext layer. Discovering the WMS URL for a map service requires that you have a platform where you can browse the services. This could be done though a GIS client such as QGIS or on a web interface such as GeoNode or GeoServer. For this example we will show you the workflow in GeoNode. First browse to the map layer in GeoNode that you want to publish in BIMS: Next click on the metadata detail button to view the metadata for the layer. On the metadata page you will see a long list of information about the layer. First make a note of the \"Title\" of the layer e.g.: LULC_2018_ Now scroll down until you find the section called \"References\" and then look for the heading \"OGC WMS: geonode Service\". Right click on the service link and choose \"Copy link location\" from your browser's context menu.

Non-biodiversity layers can be displayed on top of the base map in RBIS to provide insights about the spatial situation of collection sites. In order to add a layer to the RBIS, follow these steps : Go to admin page Click non biodiversity layer section Click Add non biodiversity layer button at the top right Fill out these required fields (see Discovering the WMS URL for a published layer): Name - The name of the layer, will be displayed in the Layer Selector WMS url - WMS url for this layer (if you're using GeoNode to host the layer you can try following link : {geonode_url}/geoserver/wms) WMS layer name - Layer name from layer provider (e.g. geonode:layer_name) WMS format - Format of the wms, default is in image/png Get feature format - Output format of the GetFeature function, the default is in text/plain Click Save button at the bottom right To set the order in which the layers are displayed on the filter click these buttons : These layers will appear in the Layer Selector on the map page.","title":"GeoContext and Visualisation Layers"},{"location":"admin/geocontext-layers/#publishing-geocontext-and-visualisation-layers","text":"This subsection describes how to publish layers as WMS (Web Mapping Services) for use by GeoContext or as Visualisation layers.

Non-biodiversity layers can be displayed on top of the base map in RBIS to provide insights about the spatial situation of collection sites. In order to add a layer to the RBIS, follow these steps : Go to admin page Click non biodiversity layer section Click Add non biodiversity layer button at the top right Fill out these required fields (see Discovering the WMS URL for a published layer): Name - The name of the layer, will be displayed in the Layer Selector WMS url - WMS url for this layer (if you're using GeoNode to host the layer you can try following link : {geonode_url}/geoserver/wms) WMS layer name - Layer name from layer provider (e.g. geonode:layer_name) WMS format - Format of the wms, default is in image/png Get feature format - Output format of the GetFeature function, the default is in text/plain Click Save button at the bottom right To set the order in which the layers are displayed on the filter click these buttons : These layers will appear in the Layer Selector on the map page.","title":"Adding a non-biodiversity layer to FBIS"},{"location":"admin/geocontext-overview/","text":"Overview of GeoContext Management \u00b6 In this guide we will explain the high level concepts of the GeoContext substystem which is used to derive location related data for each occurrence record added to RBIS. GeoContext is an independent service, available at https://geocontext.kartoza.com/ . The purpose of GeoContext is to harvest data for point locations from a range of online databases. GeoContext allows you to register WMS/WFS/WCS layers in groups which in turn can be registered in a collection. You can then pass it a point locality and it will query every layer in the collection, returning a set of values, one for each layer under the point location. As you can see from the above diagram, the workflow consist of three parts: 1) Publishing layers under e.g. WMS 2) Registering layers, groups and collections in the GeoContext service 3) Registering the GeoContext service(s) with BIMS This tutorial will lead you through all of these steps. We expect that you are already familiar with platforms such as GeoNode, GeoServer and concepts such as OGC services. We also expect that you are familiar with and understand the basic operations and management of BIMS. The following YouTube video walks through the steps described in this section of the documentation in detail with examples.
